# Reverse the Scroll

This react component will place the scroll bar at the bottom of the page on render.  The user will scroll up from the bottom to view content, instead of from top down.

## Getting Started

Run npm install

``` npm install ```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
